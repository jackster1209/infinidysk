# Repairs

Background health monitoring, PAR2 reconstruction, and replacement of unhealthy library items.

!!! tip "Headless ENV"

    Map config keys below to `NZBDAV_CONFIG__...` with the
    [naming algorithm](headless.md#naming-algorithm)
    (`repair.enable` → `NZBDAV_CONFIG__REPAIR__ENABLE`). A Library Directory and configured
    [*Arr instances](arrs.md) are optional; they are only needed to replace linked library items.

| Control | Config key | Default | Effect |
|---------|------------|---------|--------|
| Enable Background Repairs [since 1.2.5](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.5){ .nzbdav-since } | `repair.enable` | off | Enables health checks, PAR2, and damage tolerance; Library Directory + *Arr are only needed for linked-item replacement |
| Health Check Concurrency [since 0.9.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v0.9.0){ .nzbdav-since } | `repair.healthcheck-concurrency` | `50` | Worker ceiling for concurrent STAT checks; capped by the provider pool. Actual contention with playback is governed by provider-pool admission and **Streaming Priority** |
| Health Check Depth | `repair.healthcheck-depth` | `standard` | standard / enhanced / deep / complete |
| Check older releases less thoroughly [since 0.8.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v0.8.0){ .nzbdav-since } | `repair.healthcheck-aging` | off | Aging taper |
| Repair After Streaming Failures | `repair.auto-remove-after-failures` | `0` | Consecutive streaming failures before urgent repair; `0` = immediate repair |
| Auto-remove unlinked files only | `repair.auto-remove-unlinked-only` | on | At the threshold, linked items are removed and blocklisted through *Arr instead of force-deleted |
| Degraded damage tolerance [since 1.2.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.0){ .nzbdav-since } | `repair.degraded-tolerance-enabled` | on | Keep slightly damaged videos playable instead of replacing the release |
| Track corrupt articles during playback [since 1.2.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.0){ .nzbdav-since } | `repair.corruption-tracking-enabled` | on | Record streaming-confirmed corrupt articles, include them in health classification, and skip the retry storm on later reads |
| Max consecutive missing segments | `repair.degraded-max-consecutive-missing` | `2` | Longest tolerable run of adjacent holes (1–2) |
| Max total missing segments | `repair.degraded-max-total-missing` | `5` | Total tolerable holes per file (1–1000) |
| Max missing data (% of file) | `repair.degraded-max-missing-byte-percent` | `1.0` | Tolerable hole share of file bytes (0.01–50) |
| Library Directory | `media.library-dir` | empty | Organized library root in the container — parent of your Arr root folders. Never the rclone mount or `/completed-symlinks` |

## Re-check after provider changes [since 1.2.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.0){ .nzbdav-since }

Changing Usenet providers can affect which library files are available. After saving provider changes,
InfiniDysk offers to queue your library for a health re-check. This requires Background Repairs to be
enabled; urgent repairs already queued from streaming failures keep their priority.

!!! note "Streaming failure repair requires Background Repairs"

    **Repair After Streaming Failures** (`repair.auto-remove-after-failures`) only takes effect when
    **Enable Background Repairs** (`repair.enable`) is on. A Library Directory and \*Arr are only
    needed to replace linked library items. Without them, PAR2 can still reconstruct the file and
    threshold-based removal can delete unlinked items.

`repair.auto-remove-after-failures` applies only to streaming-triggered failures such as missing
articles, corrupt archives, and seeks that find missing or truncated article data. With a value
greater than `0`, InfiniDysk waits for that many consecutive failures before it starts an urgent
repair. At the threshold, linked library items are removed and their original downloads are marked
failed in \*Arr when **Auto-remove unlinked files only** is enabled. \*Arr blocklists those releases
and applies its configured failed-download redownload policy. Unlinked files are removed. Disable
that option to force-delete linked items at the threshold. With the default value `0`, failed
unlinked files are kept and surfaced as **Action needed**; set a value greater than `0` to
auto-remove them after repeated failures.

Successful full-file playback and a successful background health check reset the in-memory failure
count. The count resets when InfiniDysk restarts, so it is intentionally not a durable replacement for
health checks.

## Degraded damage tolerance [since 1.2.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.0){ .nzbdav-since }

Health checks of plain video files no longer treat every missing Usenet segment as fatal.
When a check covers **every** segment of an eligible file (files up to 8000 segments at any
depth, or any file at **Complete** depth), InfiniDysk sweeps up all confirmed misses and
classifies the damage instead of aborting on the first one. With `repair.healthcheck-aging`
enabled, releases old enough to be sampled are not classified.

- **Healthy** — no confirmed holes. A segment whose primary article is gone but that is still
  fetchable through a fallback Message-Id counts as servable, not a hole.
- **Degraded** — holes within all three caps (longest consecutive run, total count, and share
  of the file's bytes) in a container that tolerant decoders can resync past. The file stays
  mounted, playback zero-fills the gaps, and **no Arr repair is triggered**. The confirmed
  holes are recorded on the item so the status survives restarts; later playback fills them
  without sending a provider BODY request. A local PAR2 patch or segment-cache entry still wins
  over a gap fill, and the next full health sweep detects a provider-side recovery.
- **Failed** — over any cap, any hole in an unsafe layout, or an unrecognized container.
  These take the normal repair path (PAR2 reconstruction first when enabled, then Arr
  remove-and-replace when a linked library item has an enabled Arr instance). Without an Arr
  replacement path, the file remains mounted as **Action needed**.

Eligible containers: `.mkv`, `.mk3d`, `.webm`, `.ts`, `.m2ts` (resync at cluster/packet
boundaries) and `.mp4`/`.m4v`/`.mov`, whose layout is probed once from a bounded read of the
file head: fast-start and fragmented MP4 can tolerate mid-stream holes, while **moov-at-end
MP4 is fatal on any segment loss** because the moov atom lives in the file tail — holes
overlapping the moov atom region at the start of a fast-start MP4 are also fatal. Offset-
sensitive formats (`.avi`, …) and non-payload files are never classified; they keep the
legacy abort-on-first-miss behavior. A missing first segment is always fatal.

Degraded verdicts compose with the rest of the repair pipeline:

- **PAR2 first.** When PAR2 gap repair (`repair.par2-enabled`) is enabled and preferred,
  reconstruction is attempted with the full hole list before any verdict; success records a
  healthy, PAR2-repaired result and clears any recorded holes.
- **Rechecks can escalate or recover.** Degraded files stay on the normal age-doubling
  recheck schedule. If damage grows past a cap, the next check fails the file and repair
  proceeds; if the missing articles reappear (provider-side restoration), the record clears
  itself and the file returns to healthy.
- **Streaming failures still count.** A degraded verdict does not reset the consecutive
  streaming-failure counter, so genuinely unplayable files still escalate toward
  `repair.auto-remove-after-failures`.

Degraded files appear on the [Health page](../operations/health-repairs.md) with a warning
badge, a dedicated history filter, and an overview stat card.

## Realtime corruption detection [since 1.2.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.0){ .nzbdav-since }

A corrupt-but-present article (right size, STAT succeeds, yEnc CRC fails) used to play as
silent garbage. InfiniDysk now detects that on the playback path:

1. **Detect** — yEnc CRC failures surface as corrupt articles, including trailer-CRC
   corruption on exact-size segments in the unbuffered first-segment reader.
2. **Re-fetch / failover** — the reader retries across providers, then sibling donor
   Message-Ids, then gap-fills a known-length hole so later bytes stay aligned. There is
   **no synchronous PAR2** on the read path (reconstruction stays in the background).
3. **Record** — persistently corrupt segment IDs are stored on the file payload when
   `repair.corruption-tracking-enabled` is on (the default whenever Background Repairs is
   on). Later reads of those IDs probe once instead of repeating the retry storm.
4. **Classify** — full-coverage health sweeps union remaining recorded corruption with
   STAT holes, so a present-but-corrupt file is no longer reported Healthy.
5. **Escalate** — when playback actually breaks, the same streaming-failure path used for
   missing articles runs: PAR2-first when enabled, then *Arr remove-and-blocklist for linked
   library items with an enabled Arr instance.

Disable **Track corrupt articles during playback** if you need the previous retry-only
behavior. Playback-breaking corruption still schedules repair whenever Background Repairs
is on.

## Replacement-loop protection [since 0.9.4](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v0.9.4){ .nzbdav-since }

When *Arr imports a download instantly (for example over an rclone mount), a broken release can
import successfully before any health check runs. Marking an already-imported download failed does
not reliably blocklist it, so *Arr could re-grab the identical release and loop. Two safeguards
break that cycle:

- **Fail re-grabs before import.** Releases rejected by repair are remembered: when repair removes
  a broken download and marks it failed, the release's article ids are recorded (as are articles
  found definitively missing while downloading or streaming). A re-grabbed NZB containing any of
  them fails within milliseconds while still in the download queue. *Arr sees a failed download
  before import, blocklists the release, and moves on to a different one. The memory is in-process
  and resets on restart; a loop that survives a restart is stopped again after one extra cycle.
- **Per-file repair rate limit.** After repair has removed 3 downloads for the same library file
  (the same episode or movie file path — not the whole series or folder) within 6 hours, further
  repairs for that file are deferred for a day and surfaced as **Action needed** in the health
  screen instead of triggering another replacement.
